The [WordPress Editorial Calendar][http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/editorial-calendar/] collects statistics about the blogs it is used on with a software package called [Mint][http://www.haveamint.com/] and makes them public on the [Editorial Calendar Statistics]http://www.zackgrossbart.com/edcal/mint/] page.  A lot of the functionality is from the the default Mint installation.

For extra information about the Editorial Calendar we add some extensions called Peppers.  This project contains the three peppers:

*   *edcalinfo* shows informational messages about the Editorial Calendar
*   *edcalstats* shows specific statistics about the blogs using the calendar like the number of visible weeks and the number of authors.
*   *edcalusers* shows information about the individual blogs running the Editorial Calendar
